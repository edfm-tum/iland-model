/**
 * The agent based forest management engine.

Overview
========
The ABE forest management system is:
+ is a hybrid C++/Javascript system
+ follows a declarative paradigma - forest management strategies are described using Javascript-Objects (like JSON), but include also
imperative section and event handlers that allow a fine grained control

The concept is described in more details on the iLand wiki page: http://iland-model.org/ABE

building blocks
---------------

The main classes of ABE are:

+ **{{#crossLink "Agent"}}{{/crossLink}}** are conceptually forest managers that are responsible for a part or for the full simulated landscape.
+ **{{#crossLink "STP"}}{{/crossLink}}** a STP object encapsulates a stand treatment program, that includes one or many forest management activities.
+ **{{#crossLink "Activity"}}{{/crossLink}}** is a single management activity such as a thinning or a planting.


In addition, the API defines various helper objects:

+ **{{#crossLink "FMEngine"}}{{/crossLink}}** is the main class of ABE. It provides methods to define agents, stand treatment programs, etc and methods to "manually" execute forest mangement
+ **{{#crossLink "Stand"}}{{/crossLink}}** encapsulates a "stand" in the model. A landscape can have multiple stands (e.g., by providing a GIS layer).
+ **{{#crossLink "TreeList"}}{{/crossLink}}** a collection of individual trees that are e.g. fetched from a specific stand

'useSustainableHarvest' is a scaling factor (0..1) that allows gradually switching between bottom-up harvest planning (i.e., stands are always processed at their optimal dates),
and a top-down approach (i.e, the scheduling algorithm decides when a stand should be processed). A value of 1 means
 that the scheduler (assigned to the agent) is used exclusively, and 0 means a strict bottom up approach. Between 0 and 1 the harvest is scaled in between.
