/**
 * iLand Javascript API

Overview
========

iLand - the invidiual based landscape and disturbance model - is capable of simulating the development of forests on landscapes
of thousands of hectares. The model is built in C++ (using the [Qt-framework](http://qt.io) and utilizes the the built-in
V8 Javascript engine. The model exposes a number of (C++)-objects to the Javascript context, that allow accessing various iLand functions from Javascript.

See [iLand scripting](http://iland-model.org/iLand+scripting) for an overview.

 * @module iLand

/**
The Globals object exposes a series of auxiliary functions to the scripting context. An instance of "Globals" is always available in the global context, so no explicit creation is necessary.
The provided function cover inter alia:

- handling of directories and simple text files
- access to XML settings
- access and control over Outputs
- miscellaneous functions (e.g., for making screeshots)

/**
The number of resource units in the current simulation.

/**
print the contents of the message to the log. In iLand GUI the message is also printed to the screen even if a logfile is specified.
In addition to the iLand `print()` function also the built-in Javascript object `console` can be used (e.g. `console.log()`; see https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/API/Console).

Note: The global function `print()` is a short-cut to `Globals.print()`.

@method print
@param {string} message message to print as a string

shows a message box to the user (only available with iLand GUI) and halts execution until the user clicks OK.

Note: The global function `alert()` is a short-cut to `Globals.alert()`.

@method alert
@param {string} message message to show as a string

/**
Includes / runs a Javascript file. The file is loaded and evaluated in the current Javascript context. `include` is useful for loading additional
code (e.g., library style scripts), or several management programs in ABE, or several agents in BITE.

Note: The global function `include()` is a short-cut to `Globals.include()`.

@Example
    // File 1
    include('scripts/file2.js');
    print(a); // prints "defined in file2"

    // file2.js:
    var a = "defined in file2";
    // some other stuff



@method include
@param {string} name of the Javascript file to include (path relative to the project root)

/**
Completely reloads the ABE (agent based management engine) sub module. This includes loading of the (static) stand description file,
and the javascript source code of ABE.

  `viewOptions` allow some control over the visualization of the landscape in the iLand GUI. The `viewOptions` is an object with the following elements:

  + `minValue` and `maxValue`: the value range of the visualization; if not present, the value range of the ruler is automatically scaled
  + `type`: defines the type of visualization, and is one of the following:
       +  `lif`: the 'Light Influence Field' (2m)
       + `dom`: the dominant height (10m)
       + `regeneratation`: saplings/regeneration (2m)
       + `seed`: seed availability (20m)
       + `trees`: individual trees
       + `ru`: resource units (1ha)
  + `clip`: boolean ; if _true_, grids are clipped to the height grid (i.e. white for out-of-project-areas) (not supported for all visualizations)
  + `transparent`: boolean; if true, trees are drawn semi-transparent
  + `species`
       + boolean value in single tree mode: if true, draw trees using species colors (true)
       + a species short name (e.g. '_piab_'): select this species, e.g. for seed availability per species, or species shares
  + `grid`: draw one of the dynamic grids layers from active sub modules (check the possible names either in iLand or in the wiki)
  + `expression`: provides a expression that can be evaluated for trees or for resource unit (depending on the `type`)
  + `filter`: expression that is used to filter trees (useful for showing only a subset of trees)

  This option is not available in the iLand console version.

Execute a system command (e.g., for copying files). Commands are operating system dependent; For windows,

The functions causes the creation of a raster file for 'species' the next time seed dispersal is calculated. `species` is the species-id (e.g., 'piab', 'fasy'),

Seed maps are only saved once, i.e. if a time series of seed maps is needed, `seedMapToFile()` need to be called periodically.

/**
extract a grid of type `type` from iLand. The extracted grid is a floating point grid (double precision) and
a copy of the current state in iLand (memory is freed automatically during Javascript garbage collection).

The grid has a cell size of 10m or 100m (depending on the type) and covers the full extent of the model.

The available grid types with 10m resolution are:
+ `height`: dominant tree height (m)
+ `count`: number of living trees (>4m height) on each pixel
+ `standgrid` the internal standgrid of iLand (see http://iland-model.org/landscape+setup#Setting_up_the_stand_grid)
+ `valid`: pixels inside the project area get a value of 1, pixels non within the project area 0 (see [wiki page](http://iland-model.org/landscape+setup))
+ `forestoutside`: 1 if a pixel is out of project area and is considered to be forested (see [wiki page](http://iland-model.org/landscape+setup))

The available grid types with 100m resolution are:
+ `smallsaplingcover`: the fraction of the area which is covered by small saplings (<=1.3m) OR grass cover (0..1). (Note: RUs with non-stockable area have always a value <1).
+ `saplingcover`: the fraction of the area which is covered by saplings (with a height >1.3m) (0..1). (Note: RUs with non-stockable area have always a value <1).
+ `swc`: mean annual water content (mm) over the full year
+ `swc_gs`: mean annual water content (mm) during the growing season (fixed month April - September)
+ `swc_pot`: field water capacity (mm) of the resource unit (potential water content)
