/**
The `Management` object is used to for operations that remove trees from the simulation environment.
The iLand management is accessible using the global object `management`, which is available
when script code is invoked from the iLand management subsystem.

Main functions
--------------

+ Loading trees from iLand: use {{#crossLink "Management/load:method"}}{{/crossLink}} and {{#crossLink "Management/loadFromMap:method"}}{{/crossLink}} to load a list of trees
+ manipulating lists of trees: use {{#crossLink "Management/filter:method"}}{{/crossLink}} to select a sub set based on some criterion,
 or {{#crossLink "Management/sort:method"}}{{/crossLink}} to bring the list in a specific order; you can calculate {{#crossLink "Management/sum:method"}}{{/crossLink}}
 or {{#crossLink "Management/mean:method"}}{{/crossLink}} values from all trees in the list
+ removing trees: {{#crossLink "Management/manage:method"}}{{/crossLink}} and {{#crossLink "Management/kill:method"}}{{/crossLink}}
+ other functions such as....

Note that by default only living trees are processed.
Several special functions exists, e.g. a function to filter based on a predefined list of tree-ids (filter()), of methods
that select trees based on some rastered GIS data.

There are several distinct tree removal modes in iLand, namely by harvesting a tree, or by killing a tree, or due to a disturbance.
In general, harvesting removes all (aboveground) biomass from the system, while a killed trees' biomass is moved to the soil pools.
Disturbed trees behave similar to killed trees. Note, that there are further subtle differences between removal modes: for instance, resprouting
is only possible from harvested trees; or, trees killed by disturbance might be treated differently by management.

The management functions typically affect only individual trees in iLand with a height >4m. However, there are some functions available
to alter the state of the saplings (tree cohorts < 4m height).



Expressions and tree variables
------------------------------
Many function of the `management` object allow to specify a filter ([Expression](https://iland-model.org/Expression)). In the context of
management, tree variables can be used within filter expressions: see https://iland-model.org/tree+variables

Tree species can be included in Expressions by using the short name as is; internally, the species (identity) is
a integer index of the species, and species short names (such as 'piab', 'fasy', or 'pico') are used as placeholders.

such trees can act as trap trees with regard to bark beetles.

@method cutAndDrop
*/
/**
Remove all selected trees with with the _disturbance_ flag set. Disturbed trees are treated
differently with regard to carbon flows and {{#crossLinkModule "ABE"}}{{/crossLinkModule}}. Biomass of the stem and
the branches is routed to the soil and snag pools as indicated by the parameters of the function. The rest of the biomass
is removed from the system (e.g., consumed by fire). For example, if `stem_to_soil_fraction`=0.2, `stem_to_snag_fraction`=0.3, then
50% of the biomass leaves the system, 20% are added to the soil, 30% to the snag pools.

The `agent` parameter is the reason of death (i.e. the process that should be mimicked). Recognized values are 'fire', 'wind', 'barkbeetle', and 'cutdown'. For instance,
tree that are removed with the `agent` set to 'wind' act as a breeding material for bark beetles. If the `agent` parameter is `'fire'`, then serotinous trees produce extra seeds.
